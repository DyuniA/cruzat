   <h1> Favorites </h1>
   
   <h2> Favorite Book </h2>
   <p> I have no specific favorite book, because of the fact I love reading books. But most
    interesting are books based on Science, as well as books based on medical study.</p>
	
   <h2> Favorite Game </h2>
   <p> I have no specific favorite game, because my parents do not allow me to play games on a console 
   because education always comes first. But I do like playing mobile games, though.</p>
   
   <h2> Favorite Movie </h2>
   <p> Out of all the movies I have watched, my personal favorite is the 1990 movie
   "Home Alone". It's very funny and at the same time, suprising. Good to watch during 
   Christmas.</p>
   
   <h2> Favorite Songs/Music Artists </h2>
   <p> I do have a wide range of music tastes, either 80's, 90's, 00's, 10's, and Modern music.
   It is honestly surprising that I can relate to the millenials with their music taste. </p>
   
   <h2> Favorite Online Series </h2>
   <p> Some of the online series that I loved to watch are The Amazing Digital Circus and Battle for Dream Island.</p>
   <p> You can watch the first episode of Battle for Dream Island here!</p>
