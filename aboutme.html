   <h1> About Me </h1>
   
   <p> My full name is Nichole B. Cruzat, but, then again, you can call me by my first name. I was born in December 5, 2011,
   and as of June 2024, I am 12 years old. I like to draw, make stories, make figures, and read books and magazines.
   Fun fact, even as someone who has ADHD, I still excel in school. I live in Metro Manila, Philippines. I also like to
   listen to music. Awkwardly saying this, but I'm a nerd. I mean, I am not a social butterfly. I am more of an
   introvert. Still, that doesn't stop me from succeding.</p>
   <p> Here is an image of me at my graduation.</p>
